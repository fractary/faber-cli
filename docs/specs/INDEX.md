## Specification Status

All specifications are currently in **draft** status. They will be updated to **approved** status after review and before implementation begins.

## Next Steps

1. **Review Specifications**: Review all specs for completeness and accuracy
2. **Create Fresh Repository**: Set up new `faber-cli` repository for implementation
3. **Phase 1 Implementation**: Core infrastructure following SPEC-0001 through SPEC-0004
4. **Phase 2 Implementation**: Platform and binding systems following SPEC-0005 through SPEC-0007
5. **Phase 3 Implementation**: CLI and deployment following SPEC-0009 through SPEC-0012

## Reference Implementation

The `faber-agents-forge` repository provides a working example of the role/context/overlay structure and can be used as a reference during implementation.
